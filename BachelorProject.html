							<h3>Project Description</h3>
							<p>The project involves emotions. The data was personally retrieved from youtube clips. Things that were taken into account when selecting the clips were 
							the amount and type of background noise, the emotion exhibited, the gender of the person, and the length of the sample. This way 60 sampels were retrieved 
							in total, evenly split to the two emotions happiness and neutral and the gender of the speaker. These were then split 
							to 40:20 which were used for training/validation and testing respectivly. </p>
							<hr><h3>Filters</h3>
							<p>Before any sort of training could take place, the samples had to be preprocessed. This includes converting them into the right format of .wav, and applying audio filters in-order to 
							reduce the noise. The software that was used for both of these steps is ffmpeg. The filters that were used to preprocess the samples were a 
							combination of the lowpass and highpass filters, and the arnndn filter. With the lowpass and highpass filter it is possible to cut out 
							certain frequencies from the files. This means that all frequencies other than human voice frequencies can be removed. The frequency range that was used 
							was between 200 to 3000 Hz. The arnndn filter is used to reduce noise from speech using recurrent neural networks. It takes as input a model m 
							and then applies this to the sample in order try and isolate the voice. These filters were tested extensivly with different options, alone and together 
							in-order to determine the best accuracy in the training and validation set.</p>
							<hr><h3>Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
							<p>Once the preprocessing of the samples was completed, they were used to train models to be used in 3 different machine learning algorithms.
							SVM, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Grid search and 5-fold cross validation was used for SVM and Random Forest in order to determine the best 
							hyperparameters to use. Since Gaussian NB only accepts a single argument as input, which is not usually not known ahead of time, it was excluded from the grid search.
							Preliminary results of this shows that Random Forest performs better than SVM with an average accuracy of 85% compared to SVMs accuracy of 72%. For Random Forest an average 
							was taken since the results fluctuate due to the nature of the classifier. SVM returned consistent results and did not require the calculation of an average. 
							Take note that this testing is still on the training and validation set and not the final result.</p>
							<hr><h3>Results</h3>
							<p>As of the writting of this page, this project is still underway and will be completed mid-april. Once completed, 
							you will be able to find the results, research paper and a link to the github page here.</p>
