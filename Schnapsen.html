							<p>What follows is the abstract of research paper which you can download at the bottom of the page.</p>
							<hr><p>This paper investigates how different features implemented in a machine learning bot
							using neural networks impacts the performance and training time of said bot. This is
							achieved the in the card playing game schnapsen. For this experiment, a framework was
							provided with which to test the bots in playing schnapsen.</p>
							<p>20 different features were implemented in a bot and then ranked according to the
							RFE method using a linear regression algorithm. In accordance with this, 4 bots were
							created to test the hypothesis that the 11 best ranked features implemented in a bot will
							outperform any other bot and achieve at least a 50% win rate against the control bot. The
							bots are; allFeatures bot which has all the features that were ranked with RFE implement,
							11MostRelevant bot which has the 11 highest ranked(rank closest to 1) features, Mixed bot
							which contains the six highest ranked features as well as the five features ranked directly
							below the eleven highest ranked features, and the 11LeastRelevant bot which has the 11
							lowest ranked(ranks farthest away from 1) features. The hypothesis that “the training time of
							a bot is affected both by the total amount of features in the feature set as well as the
							existence of irrelevant features” was also tested.</p>
							<p>To determine which bot performed best they played 1000 games against the control
							bot each. In contrast to the aforementioned hypothesis, the 11MostRelevant bot did not
							perform the best. The allFeatures bot had the highest number of wins and the
							11LeastRelevant had the least amount of wins as was expected. The lowest training time
							was achieved by the Mixed bot, which was 4 times faster than the second fastest
							11MostRelevant bot. This may be because when certain features are hot-encoded, they are
							represented in a binary vector, which can have many values in it. The Mixed bot does not
							have a feature, which requires that much space and hence was faster.</p>
